Permutation:-
		Definitions Permutation of A, Permutation Group of A
		A permutation of a set A is a function from A to A that is both one-
		to-one and onto. A permutation group of a set A is a set of permuta-
		tions of A that forms a group under function composition.

		S(n) is non-Abelian when n >= 3

Theorem 5.1 = Products of Disjoint Cycles:-
		Every permutation of a finite set can be written as a cycle or as a
		product of disjoint cycles.

Group Isomorphism;-
		An isomorphism f from a group G to a group G! is a one-to-one map-
		ping (or function) from G onto G! that preserves the group operation.
		That is,
		for all a, b in G.
		f(ab) = f(a)f(b)
		If there is an isomorphism from G onto G, we say that G and G are
		isomorphic and write G = G!.
		It is implicit in the definition of isomorphism that isomorphic
		groups have the same order. It is also implicit in the definition of
		isomorphism that the operation on the left side of the equal sign is that
		of G, whereas the operation on the right side is that of G.

Theorem 6.2 Properties of Isomorphisms Acting on Elements;>
		Suppose that f is an isomorphism from a group G onto a group G.
		Then
		1. f carries the identity of G to the identity of G.
		2. For every integer n and for every group element a in G, f(a n ) 5
		[f(a)] n .
		3. For any elements a and b in G, a and b commute if and only if
		f(a) and f(b) commute.
		4. G 5 kal if and only if G 5 kf(a)l.
		5. |a| 5 |f(a)| for all a in G (isomorphisms preserve orders).
		6. For a fixed integer k and a fixed group element b in G, the
		equation x k 5 b has the same number of solutions in G as does
		the equation x k 5 f(b) in G.
		7. If G is finite, then G and G have exactly the same number of
		elements of every order.
